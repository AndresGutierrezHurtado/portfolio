This is my personal web portfolio where I showcase the projects I have developed, my professional experience, and the technical skills I have acquired throughout my career as a developer. I built this platform using **Next.js 15** and **React 19** to create an interactive and modern experience that reflects my passion for web development. The application includes full support for internationalization (i18n) and a fully responsive user interface, allowing me to connect with a global audience and demonstrate my ability to create professional and scalable web solutions.
